more structure

Here's what WOULD be nice...
Graphics2D
	fillRect()
	drawRect()
	fillCircle()
	drawCircle()
	drawLine()
	drawPolygon() <-- accepts a Polygon object which can be pre-triangulated for WebGL
	drawImage()
	drawArc()
	drawQuadraticCurve()
	drawBezierCurve()
	setColor()

	drawCustom()      <-- accepts a callback for canvas and gl rendering, respectively
	drawImageTiled()  <-- draws a texture, tiled
	drawGradient()    <-- draws a linear or radial gradient, 2 stops only

	lineThickness
	lineCap
	lineJoin
	lineCurveSteps


Here's what's more REALISTIC for now....
Graphics2D
	fillRect
	drawRect
	drawLine
	drawImage
	drawImageTiled
	drawCustom

	setColor

	lineThickness
