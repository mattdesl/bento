	Renderer




var renderer = autoDetectRenderer(250, 250);

canvas / webgl
	blendMode = BlendMode.ADD, NORMAL, SCREEN, MULTIPLY (?)
	setClip   - rectangular clipping region
	clearClip 
	drawImage 
	setTint   - sets RGB color tint, simple multiply
	setAlpha  - sets alpha
	clear     - clears the screen
	blendingEnabled  - if disabled in canvas, it just uses 'copy' ???
	fillRect
	drawRect
	


canvas
	cacheTints - default true; new tints will be cached based on RGB bytes. 
				 if you have lots of tinting going on you might want to set this to false,
				 it will use a secondary canvas to draw. but that may also be inefficient. 

webgl
	shader
